## PROJECT RULES

### GENERAL

-   The AI coding assistant must always follow instructions precisely.
-   The AI coding assistant must adhere to all project rules, coding standards, workflow guidelines, and best practices defined in this file.
-   Always use a CLI or a command to install dependencies or kickstart the project. Don't populate the dependencies of the project automatically.
-   When a user clicks to add a link, the link should be sent to OpenAI to get a title and quick summary to be added to the newsletter later.
    -   Titles should be short and concise, focusing on directly stating what the model is.
    -   Summaries should relate the news to the context of the newsletter "Coding with AI".
-   All API Key setup must be on a dedicated settings page, accessible via a toggle in the header. If a feature requires a key that is not set, show a warning on the page with a button to open the settings.

### CONFLICT RESOLUTION

-   If a new rule conflicts with an existing one, resolve it by clarifying the final, decided rule, OR highlight that further user confirmation is needed.

## NEWSLETTER TEMPLATE

-   The AI generates newsletters with this structure:
    -   🛠️ AI Tools Worth Checking Out: New AI tools you've saved
    -   🤖 New AI Models to Explore: Latest AI models
    -   📚 Interesting Reads: Articles and other content
    -   💭 Weekly Learnings & Insights: Your condensed thoughts and reflections
- The AI is inspired by "the news" style.
-   The newsletter should be structured like this:
    1.  Friendly greeting/intro paragraph (like "nada sozinho" style)
    2.  "This Week's Edition" summary with bullet points of what's included
    3.  Individual sections with clear headers and emojis
    4.  Personal, approachable, and genuinely helpful tone
-   Newsletter tone: Direct, straight to the point, stoic yet friendly.
    -   Pre-links: Max one line.
    -   Links list: Title of the link in bold (clickable), followed by the summary underneath. No extra context needed.
    -   Footer: One line asking for feedback.

## USER INTERFACE & USER EXPERIENCE

-   The UI and UX of this project should emulate design principles from Linear, Motion UI, Uber, and Airbnb.
-   The UI and UX of this project must be simple, minimal, and intuitive, without being overwhelming.
-   The UI and UX must feel modern, without being too over the top.
-   The user experience should feel like the user is following a story.
-   The homepage UI/UX should be revamped to create a more product-focused, story-driven experience.
-   If everything is setup (e.g., API keys), the settings should not be visible to the user. We should only show about the API keys in case the user has never set it up.
-   The homepage must adapt based on user configuration status.
-   The homepage should implement smart routing: unconfigured users go to settings, configured users to main features.
-   The homepage should have a clear narrative: "Collect → Generate → Export".
-   The main flows of the homepage should be prominently displayed as the primary story, with secondary features (past newsletters) appropriately de-emphasized.
-   The homepage should have direct, action-oriented copy: "Build your newsletter in minutes".
-   The homepage should have a card-based layout with subtle interactions.
-   The homepage should maintain consistent spacing and typography using existing design system.
-   The homepage should use a neutral color palette with purposeful contrast.
-   The homepage should have subtle process indicator for configured users.
-   The homepage should have clear calls-to-action that guide users to the right next step.
-   The homepage should have hover states with subtle color transitions.
-   The card-based navigation on the homepage should feel native to product tools.
-   The homepage should implement progressive enhancement for different user states.
-   Ensure every page is mobile-friendly.

## LINKS PAGE

-   Links on the links page (`@page.tsx`) must be displayed in a table format instead of cards. Retain the same data.
-   The "Archived Links" button should be a tab on the table.
-   The "Create Newsletter" CTA must be removed from the bottom of the links page.
-   A lazy-loaded view for archived links must be implemented.
    -   Archived links are retrieved from the `links/archive/` directory structure.
