# Building a newsletter builder for theboring.app (2025-06-11 12:09:03)

_**User**_

I'm building a new brand called theboring.app. 

This brand is all about developing apps and tools with AI. I already built a Blog using Astro, as a home for this new brand. There I'm posting the projects with description and some updates. 

Updates are just like blog posts, but they are smaller like tweets. Updates are like thoughts that I have and want to share with the world. They can be related with a project or a specific tool, or sometimes not. They might be very personal, but sometimes very business-centric. I'll share the schema of a "thought" below. 

This Astro Blog also has a newsletter. The idea is to send one weekly email, containing:
- Brand new AI tools that are interesting
- Brand new AI models that is worth checking out
- My condesed learnings for the week (compiled from the thoughts I shared in the blog). 

My idea is to build a simple newsletter builder, that will take off most of the work using LLMs. 

How I believe it can work:
- During the week, I want to have a page where I can save the links of articles, tools and models that I find interesting. These links might be from HackerNews, Reddit, Article or landing pages for products. The app must then save these links (with a date), so that I can use them later when building the newsletter. 
- Then, when I'm ready to build the newsletter, I must be able to review all links that I saved, chosing which them to keep or to remove. 
- I will also provide a list of all "thoughts" I produced that week (later on we can automate this for the builder to automatically fetch this); 
- The builder should then use a LLM to understand all this information and build a newsletter based on the template below.

The newsletter should be built in a way that can be integrated with @Kit.com . It must either create a draft using Kit.com API, or produce a file that I can import there. 

Can you build this MVP for me? Do you have any questions before starting?

Also, this project must run on free infrastructure. I will not have a running server, so it must use Vercel or something that can active for free. Note that I can also use Github as a source for storing the links, I could provide a Github Token if needed to simplify the authentication. 

Here is an example of a thought:
---
title: "How to optmize for release"
type: "insight"
date: 2025-04-23T01:20:38.027Z
projectId: "unsubscriber"
---

It took me 1.5h to build a working version of Unsubscriber for myself. It took another 15h to make it work and intuitive for others. 

What is the best way to find the middle ground between building for myself and building for others?

This is a fantastic project idea! I love the concept of using AI to streamline newsletter creation. Let me build this MVP for you.

Before I start, I have a few quick questions:

1. **Newsletter Template**: You mentioned "based on the template below" but I don't see the template. Could you share what the newsletter structure should look like?

2. **LLM Provider**: Do you have a preference for the LLM? (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, etc.)

3. **Authentication**: Should this be just for you, or do you want simple authentication? Using GitHub tokens could work well for auth too.

I'll start building the MVP with these assumptions and you can correct me:
- Next.js app deployable to Vercel
- GitHub as storage (JSON files in a repo)
- OpenAI for LLM (easily changeable)
- Simple auth using GitHub tokens
- Clean, minimal UI

Let me build the core structure:

Before you start, make sure you don't populate the dependencies of the project automatically. Always use a CLI or a command to install dependencies or kickstart the project.

You're absolutely right! Let me start fresh and use the proper CLI tools to set up the project. This is much better practice.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest newsletter-builder --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --yes
```

```

npx create-next-app@latest newsletter-builder --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alia
